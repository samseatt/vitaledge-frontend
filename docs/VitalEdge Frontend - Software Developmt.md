## 1. Introduction
The **VitalEdge Frontend** project provides healthcare professionals with a platform for monitoring patient data, analyzing genomics, and managing real-time vitals. Built with React, the application integrates with a backend that handles patient data, genomic data, and analytics. This guideline outlines best practices, design patterns, and specific instructions for developing and maintaining the VitalEdge Frontend.

We will consider the following **best practices**:

- **Component-Based Design**: Break down the UI into reusable, modular components. Complex components should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use camelCase for functions, variables, and file names, and PascalCase for component names.
- **Data-Driven Modals**: Modals should manage their state locally where appropriate and should pass form data to the parent components only on form submission.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for every API request, particularly in components dealing with patient data or vitals.
- **Avoid Inline CSS**: Use CSS modules or styled components for styling, and keep all style definitions in the `styles` folder.


## 2. Project Structure

The **VitalEdge Frontend** follows a modular and component-driven project structure to maintain clarity and scalability.

### 2.1 Folder Structure and Organization

VitalEdge follows a modular directory structure to ensure code organization and separation of concerns.

```
/src
  ├── components          // Reusable UI components
  ├── pages               // Page-specific components (Dashboard, PatientDetails)
  ├── services            // API services and configurations
  ├── styles              // Component-specific and global CSS
  ├── App.js              // Main app entry with route definitions
  ├── index.js            // Application entry point
  └── index.css           // Base CSS styles
```

### Key Folders:
- **components/**: Contains reusable UI components such as modals and form elements.
- **pages/**: Each page component represents a route, housing major views like Dashboard and PatientDetails.
- **services/**: Holds service configurations, including Axios setup for API calls.
- **styles/**: Styles for each component and global styling.


### 2.2 Component Structure and Naming Conventions

*Guidelines on naming conventions, component folder structure, and separation of concerns.*

### 2.3 Navigation

This section provides guidelines for setting up routing in VitalEdge, which includes both traditional routes and XR routes.

#### 2.3.1 Router Setup and Route Management

- **Router Setup**: Use `BrowserRouter` (aliased as `Router`) to define the application's primary routes.
- **Routes**: Define route paths with `Route` components, grouping related pages together for clarity. VitalEdge has separate sections for:
  - **Traditional Routes**: Routes like `/dashboard` and `/patients/:id`, which handle standard web interactions.
  - **XR Routes**: Specialized routes prefixed with `/xr`, like `/xr/dashboard` and `/xr/genome`, which provide 3D and AR/VR functionality.

**Example Route Structure in App.js**:
```javascript
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        {/* Traditional Routes */}
        <Route path="/" element={<Login />} />
        <Route path="/dashboard" element={<PrivateRoute><Dashboard /></PrivateRoute>} />
        <Route path="/patients/:id" element={<PrivateRoute><PatientDetails /></PrivateRoute>} />

        {/* XR Routes */}
        <Route path="/xr" element={<XRLoginPage />} /> {/* XR login route */}
        <Route path="/xr/dashboard" element={<PrivateRoute><XRDashboard /></PrivateRoute>} />
        <Route path="/xr/phenome" element={<PrivateRoute><PhenomeXR /></PrivateRoute>} />

        {/* Catch-all for undefined paths */}
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

#### 2.3.2 Private and Public Routes

VitalEdge requires certain routes to be protected, only accessible by authenticated users.

- **PrivateRoute Component**: Wraps protected routes in a `PrivateRoute` component, which checks for authentication before allowing access.
  - **Authentication Check**: Implement the `PrivateRoute` component to redirect users to `/` (login page) if they are not authenticated.
  - **Reusability**: Use this component consistently across all private routes to enforce security.

**Example of PrivateRoute Component**:
```javascript
import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const PrivateRoute = ({ children }) => {
  const isAuthenticated = !!localStorage.getItem('token'); // Check if user is authenticated
  return isAuthenticated ? children : <Navigate to="/" />;
};
```

#### 2.3.3 Traditional vs. XR Navigation

VitalEdge serves both traditional web content and XR (Extended Reality) content, requiring separate navigation paths.

- **Distinct Path Prefixes**: Prefix XR routes with `/xr` to differentiate them from standard routes.
- **Dynamic Navigation Based on User Role or Device**:
  - Consider conditionally displaying XR routes only to users with access permissions or on compatible devices.
  - This approach can help streamline the user experience by reducing visible options for users without XR access.

**Best Practices for Managing XR Routes**:
- Group XR routes together under the `/xr` path prefix to improve code organization and simplify navigation management.
- Ensure consistent use of the `PrivateRoute` component for both traditional and XR routes, preventing unauthorized access.

#### 2.3.4 Route Not Found Handling

Define a fallback route for undefined paths to prevent the app from breaking when a user navigates to an unknown URL.

- **NotFound Component**: Implement a `NotFound` component as a catch-all route to display a user-friendly error message or navigation suggestion.

**Example**:
```javascript
<Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
```


## 3. Component Development Guidelines

This section provides guidelines for creating, organizing, and maintaining reusable components in VitalEdge. Components should follow a consistent structure, allowing for easy expansion, testing, and reusability.

### 3.1 Folder Structure and Organization

1. **Atomic Design Structure** (recommended for scalable apps): Organize components by type:
   - **atoms/**: Small, reusable components like buttons, inputs, icons.
   - **molecules/**: Simple components composed of atoms, such as form fields.
   - **organisms/**: Complex components composed of atoms and molecules, like a form.
   - **templates/**: Define layouts, including reusable templates for pages.
   - **pages/**: Top-level components that represent individual pages (e.g., Dashboard, PatientDetails).

2. **Standard Folder Structure**:
   ```
   /src/components
     /atoms
       Button.js
       Input.js
     /molecules
       FormField.js
       ModalWrapper.js
     /organisms
       PatientCard.js
       PatientList.js
     /pages
       Dashboard.js
       PatientDetails.js
   ```

### 3.2 Naming Conventions

- **Component Files**: Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., `PatientDetails.js`).
- **Props and State Variables**: Use camelCase for props and state variables (e.g., `patientName`, `isModalOpen`).
- **Functions**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `handleSubmit`, `fetchPatientDetails`) and prefer `useCamelCase`.

### 3.3 Component Structure

1. **File Layout**:
   - **Imports**: Import external dependencies first, then internal components and styles.
   - **Prop Types**: Use `PropTypes` for validating props if TypeScript is not in use.
   - **Component Function**: Define the core function of the component.
   - **Event Handlers and Helpers**: Define helper functions and event handlers inside the component.
   - **Return Statement**: Structure the component's JSX clearly, using indentation for readability.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

   const PatientCard = ({ name, age, onEdit }) => {
     const handleEditClick = () => {
       onEdit(name);
     };

     return (
       <div className="patient-card">
         <h3>{name}</h3>
         <p>Age: {age}</p>
         <button onClick={handleEditClick}>Edit</button>
       </div>
     );
   };

   PatientCard.propTypes = {
     name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
     age: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
     onEdit: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
   };

   export default PatientCard;
   ```

### 3.4 Prop Management

- **Default Props**: Provide default values using `defaultProps` to avoid null values.
- **Destructure Props**: Destructure props directly in the function parameters for readability.
- **PropTypes**: Define `PropTypes` at the end of the file to enforce prop types, improving component robustness.

### 3.5 Reusability and Composition

- **Composition over Inheritance**: Use composition by nesting smaller components inside larger ones rather than using inheritance.
- **Reusable Patterns**: Design components to be flexible and reusable across different pages. For example, `ModalWrapper` can handle any form modal by passing different children.
- **Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and Hooks**: Use HOCs and custom hooks for common logic across components. Avoid code duplication in components with similar functionality.

### 3.6 Best Practices for Component Lifecycle

- **Cleanup Effects**: Use cleanup functions in `useEffect` to prevent memory leaks, especially when adding event listeners or timeouts.
- **Avoid Prop Drilling**: When passing props deeply, use React Context or a state management library to avoid unnecessary prop drilling.



## 4. State Management Best Practices

State management in VitalEdge ensures components react to data changes consistently and efficiently. This section outlines strategies for managing local, shared, and global state.

### 4.1 Local Component State

- **useState**: Use `useState` for managing local state within a single component (e.g., form inputs).
- **Naming Conventions**: Name state variables and setters descriptively, indicating their purpose (e.g., `isLoading`, `patientData`).
- **Avoid Excessive State**: Minimize the number of state variables. Combine related data into a single state object if they are updated together.

**Example**:
```javascript
const [formState, setFormState] = useState({ name: '', age: '', address: '' });

const handleInputChange = (e) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  setFormState((prev) => ({ ...prev, [name]: value }));
};
```

### 4.2 Shared State Between Components

When two or more sibling components need access to the same data:

- **Lift State Up**: Move shared state to the nearest common ancestor and pass it down as props.
- **useCallback**: Wrap functions in `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders when passing callbacks down as props.

**Example**:
```javascript
const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [sharedData, setSharedData] = useState('Hello');

  const updateData = useCallback((newData) => {
    setSharedData(newData);
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <ChildA data={sharedData} onUpdate={updateData} />
      <ChildB data={sharedData} />
    </>
  );
};
```

### 4.3 Global State Management

When multiple components across different parts of the application need access to the same state (e.g., user authentication status):

- **React Context API**: Use Context for global state that does not change frequently (e.g., theme, user settings).
- **External State Libraries**: For more complex state (e.g., multiple components need to write and read state frequently), consider libraries like Redux or Zustand.
- **Avoid Overuse of Context**: Context is ideal for infrequent updates; avoid using it for state that updates frequently (e.g., form inputs), as it can cause unnecessary re-renders across components.

**Example with Context**:
```javascript
// src/context/UserContext.js
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const UserContext = createContext();

export const UserProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}>
      {children}
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useUser = () => useContext(UserContext);
```

### 4.4 Handling Complex State

For forms and other complex states, use `useReducer` to manage state changes in a more organized way.

- **useReducer**: Use `useReducer` when managing state with complex updates or multiple interdependent values (e.g., multi-step forms).
- **Separate Reducer Logic**: Place reducers outside the component for better readability and testability.

**Example with useReducer**:
```javascript
const formReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_NAME':
      return { ...state, name: action.value };
    case 'SET_AGE':
      return { ...state, age: action.value };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(formReducer, { name: '', age: '' });

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={state.name}
        onChange={(e) => dispatch({ type: 'SET_NAME', value: e.target.value })}
      />
      <input
        type="number"
        value={state.age}
        onChange={(e) => dispatch({ type: 'SET_AGE', value: e.target.value })}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 4.5 Side Effects with useEffect

**useEffect** is a core tool for handling side effects such as data fetching and subscription in VitalEdge.

- **Dependency Array**: Specify dependencies to avoid unnecessary re-renders. When a dependency changes, `useEffect` re-runs.
- **Cleanup Functions**: If a side effect involves setting up a subscription or event listener, return a cleanup function to avoid memory leaks.
- **Async Functions in useEffect**: To fetch data, declare an async function inside `useEffect` and call it immediately.

**Example**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await apiCall();
      setData(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    }
  };
  fetchData();
}, [dependency]);
```

### 4.6 Performance Optimizations

- **Memoization with useMemo**: Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations, so they only re-compute when dependencies change.
- **Memoized Callbacks**: Use `useCallback` to memoize callback functions, which is particularly useful when passing functions to child components to prevent re-renders.
- **Avoiding Unnecessary State Updates**: Only update state when necessary. Use conditional checks to avoid redundant state changes, which can reduce re-renders.



## 5. Creating Modals

Modals in VitalEdge are used for creating, editing, and managing data records, such as patient details or vitals. To standardize and streamline modal creation, follow these guidelines.

### 5.1 Modal Structure and Wrapper

Create a `ModalWrapper` component to encapsulate common modal functionalities such as opening, closing, and form submission.

**ModalWrapper Component**:
```javascript
// src/components/ModalWrapper.js
import React from 'react';

const ModalWrapper = ({ isOpen, onClose, onSubmit, title, children }) => {
  if (!isOpen) return null;

  return (
    <div className="modal">
      <div className="modal-content">
        <h3>{title}</h3>
        <form onSubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); onSubmit(); }}>
          {children}
          <div className="modal-footer">
            <button type="submit">Save</button>
            <button type="button" onClick={onClose}>Cancel</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ModalWrapper;
```

### 5.2 Creating a Modal for Patient Editing

Use `ModalWrapper` as the base for specific modals, like editing patient details.

**EditPatientModal Component**:
```javascript
// src/components/EditPatientModal.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ModalWrapper from './ModalWrapper';

const EditPatientModal = ({ isOpen, onClose, onSave, name, age, address }) => {
  const [editName, setEditName] = useState(name);
  const [editAge, setEditAge] = useState(age);
  const [editAddress, setEditAddress] = useState(address);

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    onSave({ name: editName, age: editAge, address: editAddress });
  };

  return (
    <ModalWrapper
      isOpen={isOpen}
      onClose={onClose}
      onSubmit={handleSubmit}
      title="Edit Patient Details"
    >
      <label>Name: <input type="text" value={editName} onChange={(e) => setEditName(e.target.value)} /></label>
      <label>Age: <input type="number" value={editAge} onChange={(e) => setEditAge(e.target.value)} /></label>
      <label>Address: <input type="text" value={editAddress} onChange={(e) => setEditAddress(e.target.value)} /></label>
    </ModalWrapper>
  );
};

export default EditPatientModal;
```

### 5.3 Adding Vitals via Modal

Similarly, `AddVitalModal` uses `ModalWrapper` for a consistent structure.

**AddVitalModal Component**:
```javascript
// src/components/AddVitalModal.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ModalWrapper from './ModalWrapper';

const AddVitalModal = ({ isOpen, onClose, onSave }) => {
  const [heartRate, setHeartRate] = useState('');
  const [systolic, setSystolic] = useState('');
  const [diastolic, setDiastolic] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    onSave({ heartRate, systolic, diastolic });
  };

  return (
    <ModalWrapper
      isOpen={isOpen}
      onClose={onClose}
      onSubmit={handleSubmit}
      title="Add New Vital Signs"
    >
      <label>Heart Rate: <input type="number" value={heartRate} onChange={(e) => setHeartRate(e.target.value)} /></label>
      <label>Systolic BP: <input type="number" value={systolic} onChange={(e) => setSystolic(e.target.value)} /></label>
      <label>Diastolic BP: <input type="number" value={diastolic} onChange={(e) => setDiastolic(e.target.value)} /></label>
    </ModalWrapper>
  );
};

export default AddVitalModal;
```

### 5.4 Using Modals in a Parent Component

When adding modals in a parent component, such as `PatientDetails.js`, use the `isOpen`, `onClose`, and `onSave` props to manage their visibility and data handling.

```javascript
// Example usage in PatientDetails.js
<EditPatientModal
  isOpen={isEditModalOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsEditModalOpen(false)}
  onSave={handleEditPatient}
  name={patient?.name}
  age={patient?.age}
  address={patient?.address}
/>

<AddVitalModal
  isOpen={isAddVitalModalOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsAddVitalModalOpen(false)}
  onSave={handleAddVitalSign}
/>
```



## 6. API Integration

The VitalEdge frontend relies on multiple REST APIs to interact with various services within the ecosystem (e.g., standard API, genomic API, aggregator API). This section provides guidelines on configuring and managing API requests efficiently and securely.

### 6.1 Axios Configuration and API Instances

**Objective**: Use `axios` for HTTP requests, with separate instances configured for each service endpoint to maintain modularity and ease of debugging.

- **Centralized Configuration**: All API instances are configured in a single `axios.js` file using the `createAxiosInstance` function. Each instance uses a unique `baseURL` sourced from environment variables (`.env`), ensuring flexibility across different environments.
- **JWT Authorization**: Each API instance uses an interceptor to automatically attach the JWT token in the `Authorization` header for every request.

**Best Practices**:
- Define all base URLs in `BASE_URLS` and make them environment-dependent.
- Use the `Authorization` header to attach the JWT token, retrieved from `localStorage`, ensuring secure API calls.
- For easy maintenance, add new API endpoints as separate instances in `axios.js`.

**Example**:
```javascript
const BASE_URLS = {
  standard: process.env.REACT_APP_STANDARD_API_URL,
  genomic: process.env.REACT_APP_GENOMIC_API_URL,
  // Add other APIs as necessary
};

const createAxiosInstance = (baseURL) => {
  const instance = axios.create({ baseURL });
  instance.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
    if (token) config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
    return config;
  });
  return instance;
};

export const standardApi = createAxiosInstance(BASE_URLS.standard);
export const genomicApi = createAxiosInstance(BASE_URLS.genomic);
```

### 6.2 Token Management and Interceptors

**Purpose**: Ensure every API call carries a valid JWT token, allowing APIs to authenticate users securely.

- **Request Interceptors**: Automatically attach the JWT token from `localStorage` to each request. This centralizes token management, reducing redundancy across API calls.
- **Response Interceptors**: Manage `401` (unauthorized) and `403` (forbidden) responses by removing the token and redirecting to the login page when necessary.

**Refresh Tokens**:
If JWT tokens have a short expiration time, consider implementing a token refresh strategy. On receiving a `401` due to token expiration, attempt to refresh the token before retrying the failed request.

**Example Response Interceptor**:
```javascript
instance.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  (error) => {
    if (error.response && (error.response.status === 401 || error.response.status === 403)) {
      localStorage.removeItem('token');
      window.location.href = '/login';
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

### 6.3 Environment-Based Configuration

Use environment variables to control the API URLs and manage access across different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).

- Define all API URLs in `.env` files (`REACT_APP_STANDARD_API_URL`, etc.).
- **Example**: Store sensitive information, such as API URLs and any credentials, in environment-specific `.env` files and avoid hardcoding them in the codebase.



## 7. Error Handling and Logging

Robust error handling and logging are essential for diagnosing issues and ensuring the app remains user-friendly. This section covers best practices for managing errors effectively in the VitalEdge frontend.

### 7.1 Error Handling Strategy

**Types of Errors**:
- **API Errors**: Handle API-specific errors, such as network issues, `401` (unauthorized), or `500` (server error) responses.
- **Application Errors**: Capture unexpected errors within the React components or UI logic.
- **Validation Errors**: Display user-friendly messages for input validation errors, ensuring a smooth user experience.

**Centralized Error Handling**:
- Use `axios` interceptors to handle common API errors (`401` unauthorized, `403` forbidden) and direct users to appropriate actions, such as re-authentication.
- **UI Feedback**: Show meaningful error messages in the UI when API errors occur, instead of generic error alerts. Provide messages that guide users on how to proceed or correct their input.

### 7.2 User Feedback and Error Messages

**Guidelines for User-Friendly Error Messages**:
- **Clarity**: Avoid technical jargon. Use simple language that users can understand (e.g., "Network error. Please check your internet connection and try again.").
- **Consistency**: Follow a consistent pattern in how messages are displayed, both in tone and in UI placement.
- **Contextual Guidance**: When possible, provide guidance on how to resolve the issue (e.g., “Session expired. Please log in again.”).

**Example UI Error Message**:
```javascript
const ErrorMessage = ({ message }) => (
  <div className="error-message">
    {message}
  </div>
);
```

### 7.3 Logging and Debugging

Implement structured logging to aid debugging and track issues.

- **Console Logs for Development**: Use `console.error` for logging API errors during development, but avoid excessive logging in production.
- **External Logging Services**: For production environments, consider integrating a logging service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) to capture errors in real-time. These services provide insights into user behavior leading up to the error and help track issues across different environments.
- **Error Boundaries**: Use React’s `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and handle errors that occur within the component tree, preventing the app from crashing.

**Example of Error Boundary**:
```javascript
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    console.error("Error caught by boundary:", error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) return <h2>Something went wrong.</h2>;
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```



## 8. Security and Authentication

VitalEdge deals with sensitive healthcare data, so it’s crucial to implement secure and compliant authentication and data handling practices.

### 8.1 JWT Authentication and Secure Token Storage

**JWT Authentication**:
- **Single Token Across APIs**: The VitalEdge frontend uses a single JWT token for accessing multiple APIs. This token is issued by the main authentication backend, validated by all dependent services.
- **Token Expiry**: Ensure tokens have a reasonable expiration time. Shorter token lifespans improve security but may require implementing token refresh mechanisms.

**Token Storage**:
- **LocalStorage**: Store the JWT token in `localStorage` for easy access in `axios` interceptors. However, be mindful that `localStorage` is vulnerable to XSS attacks.
- **HttpOnly Cookies (Alternative)**: Consider using HttpOnly cookies if the backend supports it. HttpOnly cookies are inaccessible to JavaScript, providing a secure alternative to `localStorage`.

### 8.2 Token Management and Refresh Strategy

**Token Refresh**:
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: If tokens expire frequently, consider implementing a token refresh strategy. Check the token’s expiry before making requests, and use a `refresh_token` endpoint to obtain a new token without interrupting the user session.
- **Error Handling for Expired Tokens**: When a `401` or `403` response is detected due to an expired token, automatically remove the token, redirect to login, and notify the user.

**Example Token Refresh Flow**:
1. Store the `refresh_token` securely in `HttpOnly` cookies or another secure storage.
2. When a `401` response is received, attempt to refresh the token using the `refresh_token`.
3. If the refresh is successful, retry the original request with the new token; otherwise, log out the user.

### 8.3 Secure API Communication (HTTPS and CORS)

**HTTPS**:
- Enforce HTTPS for all API requests to protect data in transit. Ensure all endpoints used by the frontend are HTTPS-enabled, particularly in production environments.

**CORS**:
- **CORS Policies**: Configure CORS on each API to restrict access to trusted origins. Only allow requests from VitalEdge frontend’s origin (e.g., `https://vitaledge.com`).
- **Proxy for Sensitive Operations**: For APIs that require more restrictive access, use the backend as a proxy, allowing CORS only on the backend API.

### 8.4 CSRF Protection and Rate Limiting

**CSRF Protection**:
- **Token-Based**: If using cookies for JWT storage, implement CSRF protection. Add a CSRF token in headers for state-changing requests (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Double Submit Cookie Pattern**: For cookies, add a CSRF token as a cookie and include it in the request headers. The server validates that the header token matches the cookie value.

**Rate Limiting**:
- **API Rate Limits**: Protect APIs from abuse by implementing rate limits on endpoints. This is particularly important for sensitive operations or high-traffic APIs.
- **Frontend Throttling**: Implement frontend-side throttling for user-triggered requests, such as search or form submissions, to reduce unnecessary API calls.

### 8.5 User Authentication Workflow

1. **Login**: When the user logs in, obtain and store the JWT token in `localStorage` or a secure cookie.
2. **

Token Refresh (if applicable)**: Handle token refreshes using a dedicated endpoint and refresh tokens.
3. **Logout**: Clear tokens from storage upon logout and redirect users to the login page.

### Summary of Security Best Practices

- **JWT Storage**: Use `localStorage` for easy access or HttpOnly cookies for improved security.
- **Token Refresh**: Implement a refresh mechanism if tokens have short lifespans.
- **CORS and HTTPS**: Ensure all API calls are HTTPS and configure CORS for trusted origins only.
- **CSRF Protection and Rate Limiting**: Add CSRF tokens for state-changing requests and implement rate limits for sensitive operations.

By following these guidelines, the VitalEdge frontend will maintain robust security practices, protecting sensitive data while ensuring a secure and seamless user experience.



## 9. Styling and Theming Guidelines

The **VitalEdge Frontend** uses a structured approach to styling, ensuring consistency, maintainability, and scalability across components and pages. This section provides detailed guidelines on using CSS effectively, organizing styles, and implementing a theme for the project.

- **Organize CSS**: Use `global.css` for global styles and component-specific CSS files for modularity.
- **CSS Variables**: Use variables in `:root` for consistent theming.
- **Utility Classes**: Create utilities for common patterns to avoid duplication.
- **Button and Input Consistency**: Style buttons and inputs globally for a unified look.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure all components adapt to different screen sizes using a mobile-first approach.

### 9.1 Core Styling Principles

1. **CSS Modularity**: Use individual CSS files for component-specific styles (e.g., `PatientDetails.css` for `PatientDetails.js`). This keeps styles scoped and maintainable.
2. **Global CSS**: Place global styles (like resets, colors, typography) in `global.css`. This is where overarching styles and reusable classes are defined.
3. **CSS Variables for Theming**: Use CSS variables (in `:root` in `global.css`) for colors, spacing, and other theming constants. Variables ensure consistency and simplify theme switching.



### 9.2 Global Styles (`global.css`)

#### Purpose
The global CSS file (`global.css`) contains foundational styles such as resets, color variables, typography, buttons, and utility classes. It sets a uniform baseline and defines reusable elements for consistency across the project.

#### Key Sections

- **Reset Styles**: Use a basic reset (`*`, `*::before`, `*::after`) to avoid cross-browser inconsistencies.
- **CSS Variables**: Define theme colors, typography, and spacing in `:root` so they can be easily referenced throughout components.
- **Utility Classes**: Create utility classes for common styles (e.g., spacing, flex layout) to avoid duplication across components.
- **Button and Input Styling**: Centralize button and form input styles to keep these elements consistent across the app.

**Sample Global Styles (global.css)**:
```css
/* Reset */
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

/* Typography and Colors */
:root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;
  --secondary-color: #6c757d;
  --success-color: #28a745;
  --error-color: #dc3545;
  --background-color: #f9f9f9;
  --text-color: #333;
}

/* Buttons */
button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
}
button:hover {
  background-color: var(--link-hover-color);
}
```



### 9.3 Component-Specific Styles

Each component should have its own CSS file with styles specific to that component. Place all component styles within the `styles` folder, following a `PascalCase` naming convention (e.g., `PatientDetails.css` for `PatientDetails.js`).

#### Guidelines

1. **Scope Styling**: Ensure that styles are specific to the component by using `.component-name` prefixes if needed.
2. **Limit Global CSS Overrides**: Avoid overrides of global styles in component CSS files to prevent unexpected conflicts.
3. **Consistent Spacing and Font Sizes**: Follow consistent margins, padding, and font sizes. Use predefined utility classes from `global.css` when possible to maintain uniformity.

**Example Component Styles (PatientDetails.css)**:
```css
.patient-details-container {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: auto;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: var(--background-color);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.patient-info p {
  color: #555;
}

.button-group {
  display: flex;
  gap: 10px;
}
```

### 9.4 Theming Approach

Use **CSS variables** to create a flexible theming system. This allows easy adjustments to colors and fonts throughout the project without requiring modifications in individual CSS files. VitalEdge's global CSS sets up theme variables (e.g., `--primary-color`, `--background-color`) in the `:root` pseudo-class.

#### Adding a Dark Mode Theme

1. Define variables for both light and dark modes in `:root` and `body.dark-theme` respectively.
2. Apply the dark theme by toggling a `dark-theme` class on the `body` element. This can be managed via a toggle in the app settings.

**Example Dark Theme CSS**:
```css
/* Dark Theme */
body.dark-theme {
  --background-color: #222;
  --text-color: #e0e0e0;
  --primary-color: #0d6efd;
  --secondary-color: #444;
}
```

### 9.5 Utility Classes and Layout Helpers

Use utility classes for common layout adjustments (e.g., `mt-1`, `mb-2`, `flex`). Define these utilities in `global.css` to standardize spacing and layout.

#### Examples of Utility Classes

- **Spacing Utilities**: `.mt-1`, `.mb-2` for consistent margins and padding.
- **Flexbox Helpers**: `.flex`, `.flex-column` for flexible and consistent layout alignment.
- **Text Alignment**: `.text-center` for text alignment.

### 9.6 Button and Form Styling

Buttons and forms are central to user interactions in the app, so it’s important to have a consistent style across components.

#### Button Styling

- Define button styles in `global.css` to enforce a consistent look across all components.
- Use color variables (e.g., `--primary-color`, `--secondary-color`) to align with the theme.

**Button Styles**:
```css
button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
  color: #fff;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
}
button:hover {
  background-color: var(--link-hover-color);
}
```

#### Form Elements Styling

- Style form elements globally to maintain uniform input fields across components.
- Use consistent padding, font sizes, and border-radius values to align inputs with buttons.

**Form Input Styles**:
```css
input[type="text"],
textarea {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
  transition: border-color 0.3s;
}
input:focus,
textarea:focus {
  border-color: var(--primary-color);
  outline: none;
}
```

### 9.7 Modal Styling

The modal styles are defined in both `global.css` and specific modal CSS files (e.g., `PatientDetails.css`). Ensure modal styling is consistent across components.

- **Background Overlay**: Apply a semi-transparent overlay to darken the background when a modal is open.
- **Modal Container**: Center the modal content and set fixed width constraints for a polished, uniform look.

**Example Modal Styling**:
```css
.modal {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.modal-content {
  background-color: #fff;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  max-width: 500px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

### 9.8 Accessibility (a11y) Best Practices

To ensure the app is accessible to all users, follow these guidelines:

- **Color Contrast**: Ensure text has sufficient contrast against backgrounds (use tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)).
- **Focus Styles**: Define focus styles for all interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links, form inputs) for keyboard navigation.
- **ARIA Attributes**: Use ARIA roles and attributes (e.g., `aria-labelledby`, `aria-modal`) to improve screen reader accessibility.

### 9.9 Responsive Design

VitalEdge should be fully responsive to support use on different screen sizes. Use a mobile-first approach, adding media queries for larger screens.

#### Media Query Breakpoints

Define breakpoints in `global.css` to create consistent responsive layouts across the app. For example:
- **Small Devices** (max-width: 576px)
- **Medium Devices** (min-width: 768px)
- **Large Devices** (min-width: 992px)

**Example Media Queries**:
```css
/* Small devices (phones) */
@media (max-width: 576px) {
  .container {
    padding: 10px;
  }
}

/* Medium devices (tablets) */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    padding: 20px;
  }
}
```


## 10. Testing Guidelines

Effective testing is crucial for ensuring that the VitalEdge frontend behaves as expected, interacts with APIs correctly, and provides a seamless user experience. This section provides a roadmap for setting up and structuring tests in the React frontend, covering **Unit Testing**, **Integration Testing**, and **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**.

### 10.1 Testing Tools and Setup

**Recommended Testing Tools**:
1. **Jest**: A test runner and assertion library for JavaScript, ideal for unit and integration tests.
2. **React Testing Library**: A library built on Jest that focuses on testing component behavior from a user’s perspective. It’s preferred for testing React components.
3. **Cypress**: An end-to-end testing framework that simulates user interactions, suitable for testing the entire application in a real browser environment.

**Initial Setup**:
1. **Install Jest and React Testing Library** (usually included in Create React App):
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
   ```
2. **Install Cypress for E2E Testing**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev cypress
   ```
3. **Configuration Files**: Create a `jest.config.js` file if specific Jest configurations are needed (e.g., code coverage or mock files). For Cypress, include a `cypress.json` configuration file.

### 10.2 Unit Testing

Unit tests verify that individual functions, components, or services behave as expected. These tests should be fast, isolated, and cover the component logic and output.

- **Unit Tests**: Use Jest and React Testing Library for isolated component testing and mock API calls.
- **Integration Tests**: Test workflows involving multiple components and API calls, ensuring seamless data flow.
- **E2E Tests with Cypress**: Test complete user journeys, focusing on routing, authentication, and interaction with the backend.
- **Best Practices**: Organize tests for maintainability, aim for high coverage on core features, and automate testing in your CI/CD pipeline.

#### 10.2.1 Testing Functional Components

**Focus**: Verify component rendering, props, and individual behaviors.

- **Rendering Tests**: Ensure components render correctly with default props and initial states.
- **Props Validation**: Test that components render expected content when receiving different prop values.
- **Event Handling**: Simulate user interactions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) and verify corresponding component updates.

**Example**:
```javascript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import PatientDetails from './PatientDetails';

test('renders PatientDetails component', () => {
  render(<PatientDetails patient={{ name: 'John Doe', age: 30 }} />);
  expect(screen.getByText(/John Doe/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText(/30/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});

test('handles button click', () => {
  const handleClick = jest.fn();
  render(<button onClick={handleClick}>Submit</button>);
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText(/Submit/i));
  expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

#### 10.2.2 Testing API Calls and Axios Mocks

API calls to backend services are integral to the VitalEdge frontend. Test these calls using mocks to isolate the logic from actual server requests.

- **Mocking API Responses**: Use `jest.mock` for `axios` to simulate API responses. This allows testing of components that rely on API calls without depending on actual server responses.
- **Error Handling**: Verify that components handle API failures gracefully by testing error states.

**Example**:
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import PatientDetails from './PatientDetails';

jest.mock('axios');

test('fetches and displays patient data', async () => {
  axios.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: { name: 'John Doe', age: 30 } });
  render(<PatientDetails />);
  await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByText(/John Doe/i)).toBeInTheDocument());
});
```

### 10.3 Integration Testing

Integration tests check interactions between components and external services (e.g., backend APIs, authentication systems) to ensure they work together as expected.

#### 10.3.1 Component Integration

Integration tests validate that a series of components work together. Focus on:
- **Component Interactions**: Verify that data flows correctly between parent and child components.
- **User Workflow**: Simulate workflows that require multiple component interactions (e.g., form submission updating a list).

**Example**:
```javascript
test('submitting form updates patient list', async () => {
  render(<Dashboard />);
  fireEvent.change(screen.getByPlaceholderText(/patient name/i), { target: { value: 'Jane Doe' } });
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText(/Add Patient/i));
  await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByText(/Jane Doe/i)).toBeInTheDocument());
});
```

#### 10.3.2 Private Routes and Authentication

For components protected by authentication (e.g., routes wrapped in `PrivateRoute`), test both authenticated and unauthenticated states.

- **Mock Authentication State**: Mock the authentication check in `PrivateRoute` to simulate authorized and unauthorized states.
- **Protected Routes**: Verify that unauthorized users are redirected to the login page, while authenticated users access the protected content.

**Example**:
```javascript
test('redirects to login if not authenticated', () => {
  localStorage.removeItem('token');
  render(<PrivateRoute><Dashboard /></PrivateRoute>);
  expect(screen.queryByText(/Dashboard/i)).not.toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### 10.4 End-to-End (E2E) Testing with Cypress

E2E tests simulate real user interactions in a browser, verifying that the entire app works correctly from the user’s perspective. Use Cypress for these tests to check the full user experience, including routing, API calls, and UI behavior.

#### 10.4.1 Setting Up Cypress

1. **Create Cypress Tests**: Store Cypress tests in `cypress/integration`.
2. **Launch Cypress**: Start Cypress with `npx cypress open` to run tests interactively or `npx cypress run` for headless testing.

#### 10.4.2 Writing E2E Tests

**Example E2E Test**:
The following example tests a user login and navigation to the dashboard.

```javascript
describe('User Login and Dashboard Access', () => {
  it('logs in and navigates to the dashboard', () => {
    cy.visit('/');
    cy.get('input[name="username"]').type('testuser');
    cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('password');
    cy.get('button').contains('Login').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
    cy.contains('Dashboard').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```

#### 10.4.3 Best Practices for E2E Tests

- **Clear State Between Tests**: Reset data or state between tests to ensure tests are independent and repeatable.
- **Avoid Excessive API Mocking**: Since E2E tests simulate real user actions, interact with the actual API whenever possible to test realistic conditions.
- **Setup and Teardown**: Use `before` and `after` hooks to handle setup and cleanup tasks, such as logging in once for all tests in a suite.


### 10.5 Best Practices for Test Organization and Coverage

1. **Organize by Component**: Group unit and integration tests in a `__tests__` folder within each component’s directory, making it easy to locate tests related to specific components.
2. **Separate Test Types**: Use distinct folders for unit (`__tests__/unit`), integration (`__tests__/integration`), and E2E (`cypress/integration`) tests.
3. **Test Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage, especially for critical components and core user workflows. Focus on:
   - Key components (e.g., PatientDetails, Dashboard).
   - Authentication and protected routes.
   - User workflows involving data entry, submission, and API interactions.
4. **Automate Testing**: Integrate tests into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically run tests on each pull request or commit, ensuring new changes don’t introduce regressions.



## 11. Deployment and Environment Configuration

Deployment and environment configuration for the VitalEdge frontend require best practices to ensure seamless integration with other subsystems, scalability, and efficient debugging. This section outlines the setup for deploying the React app in a Docker container, configuring environment variables for various environments (local, staging, production), and integrating with backend and external services.

- **Docker and Multi-Stage Builds**: Use multi-stage Docker builds to create lightweight production images with Nginx.
- **Environment Variables**: Configure environment-specific variables in `.env` files for local development and secure storage solutions for cloud.
- **Container Orchestration**: Use Docker Compose for local development, ECS for managed deployments, and Kubernetes for scalable microservice architecture.
- **CI/CD Automation**: Automate

 build and deployment pipelines with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or other CI/CD tools.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Set up monitoring and centralized logging to maintain application performance and troubleshoot issues.

### 11.1 Dockerized Deployment

VitalEdge runs in a Docker container for portability across environments, whether on a local machine or in a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure). The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build to optimize image size and production-readiness.

#### Dockerfile Overview

The provided Dockerfile follows a multi-stage build process:
1. **Build Stage**: Compiles the React app using a Node.js base image.
2. **Production Stage**: Uses Nginx to serve the static files, creating a lightweight, optimized production image.

**Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the React app
FROM node:18 as build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json to install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the app source code into the container
COPY . .

# Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the React app using Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy custom Nginx configuration to the container
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Copy the built React app from the previous stage
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to the outside world
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx when the container starts
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

#### Running the Container Locally

To test the Dockerized app locally, build and run the Docker image with the following commands:

```bash
docker build -t vitalegde-frontend .
docker run --rm -d -p 3000:80 vitalegde-frontend
```

### 11.2 Environment Configuration and Variables

VitalEdge frontend requires configuration for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production). Environment variables control API endpoints, authentication tokens, and other settings, allowing seamless transitions across environments.

#### Environment Variables in `.env` Files

Define environment-specific variables in `.env` files, ensuring that secrets are not hardcoded into the codebase. For example:
- **REACT_APP_STANDARD_API_URL**: Backend API for authentication and main services.
- **REACT_APP_GENOMIC_API_URL**: Endpoint for genomic services.
- **REACT_APP_ANALYSIS_API_URL**: Endpoint for analysis services.
- **REACT_APP_ENV**: Environment identifier (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`).

**Example `.env` File**:
```plaintext
# Base API URLs
REACT_APP_STANDARD_API_URL=http://backend-api.local
REACT_APP_GENOMIC_API_URL=http://genomic-api.local
REACT_APP_ANALYSIS_API_URL=http://analysis-api.local

# Environment Identifier
REACT_APP_ENV=development
```

#### Injecting Environment Variables in Docker

Environment variables can be passed to the Docker container at runtime or build time, depending on the deployment scenario.

1. **Runtime Variables**: Pass variables during container runtime to avoid embedding them in the Docker image.
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -d -p 3000:80 --env-file .env vitalegde-frontend
   ```

2. **Docker Compose for Multiple Containers**:
   Use Docker Compose for deploying the VitalEdge frontend alongside other services (e.g., backend, databases) locally or in development. Docker Compose simplifies service management and network configuration across containers.

   **Example `docker-compose.yml`**:
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     frontend:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "3000:80"
       env_file:
         - .env
       depends_on:
         - backend
         - database
     backend:
       image: vitalegde-backend:latest
       ports:
         - "8080:8080"
     database:
       image: postgres:latest
       environment:
         POSTGRES_USER: user
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
         POSTGRES_DB: vitalegde
   ```

### 11.3 Deployment to Cloud Providers

Deploy the VitalEdge frontend to cloud platforms such as **AWS ECS**, **EKS (Kubernetes)**, or other container orchestration services. Here’s an overview of how to approach deployments on each platform.

#### AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)

1. **Create an ECS Cluster**: Use either Fargate (serverless) or EC2-based ECS.
2. **Define Task Definition**: Set up the task with the Docker image, ports, and environment variables.
3. **Environment Variables**: Set environment variables in the ECS Task Definition to avoid hardcoding.
4. **Load Balancer**: Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to manage incoming traffic, allowing for secure and scalable access.

#### Kubernetes (e.g., AWS EKS)

1. **Define Deployment and Service**: Use Kubernetes YAML manifests to define the frontend’s deployment and expose it using a LoadBalancer service.
2. **Secrets and ConfigMaps**: Store environment variables securely with Kubernetes `ConfigMap` and sensitive data (e.g., API tokens) in `Secrets`.
3. **Scaling and Updates**: Configure replicas and rolling updates in the deployment manifest to handle increased traffic and zero-downtime updates.

**Example Kubernetes Deployment YAML**:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: vitalegde-frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: vitalegde-frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: vitalegde-frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: frontend
        image: vitalegde-frontend:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: REACT_APP_STANDARD_API_URL
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: vitalegde-config
              key: REACT_APP_STANDARD_API_URL
```

### 11.4 CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Deployment

To automate the deployment process, use a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline with tools such as GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI.

1. **Build and Test**: Build the Docker image and run tests (unit, integration) before deployment.
2. **Push to Registry**: Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR, Docker Hub) after a successful build.
3. **Deploy to Cloud**: Use deployment jobs to update the cloud environment (ECS, EKS) with the new image.

**Example GitHub Actions Workflow**:
```yaml
name: Deploy to ECS

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Log in to Amazon ECR
        id: login-ecr
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1

      - name: Build, tag, and push image to ECR
        env:
          ECR_REGISTRY: ${{ secrets.ECR_REGISTRY }}
          ECR_REPOSITORY: vitalegde-frontend
        run: |
          docker build -t $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:latest .
          docker push $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:latest

      - name: Deploy to ECS
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v1
        with:
          task-definition: ecs-task.json
          service: vitalegde-frontend-service
          cluster: vitalegde-cluster
```

### 11.5 Managing Configuration Across Environments

1. **Environment-Specific Variables**: Use `.env` files for local development, ConfigMaps and Secrets for Kubernetes, and ECS environment variables for cloud deployments.
2. **Sensitive Data Handling**: Store sensitive information (e.g., tokens) in a secure manner, such as Kubernetes Secrets or AWS Secrets Manager.
3. **Config Consistency**: Ensure configuration consistency across environments to reduce unexpected behavior during deployment.

### 11.6 Monitoring and Logging

After deployment, monitoring and logging are essential to maintain app stability and performance.

- **Monitoring**: Use tools like AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, or Grafana to monitor container health, CPU/memory usage, and request response times.
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs from each container using services like AWS CloudWatch Logs or ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). This helps in identifying errors and tracking user activities.

- **Screen Reader Support**: Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) have appropriate ARIA labels and roles.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Verify that all parts of the application are accessible via keyboard alone, and improve focus management for modals and forms.
- **Color Contrast and Text Scaling**: Test and adjust color contrast to meet WCAG standards, and implement support for dynamic text scaling to accommodate visually impaired users.

### 12.8 Offline Mode and Progressive Web App (PWA) Support

**Objective**: Enable the app to function offline and improve user experience in low-connectivity environments.

- **Service Workers**: Configure service workers to cache essential resources and assets, allowing users to access parts of the application offline.
- **Offline Data Sync**: Implement background data sync capabilities to queue updates when offline and automatically sync them when connectivity is restored.
- **Add to Home Screen**: Convert the app to a Progressive Web App (PWA) that users can add to their home screens for quick access, providing a more app-like experience.

### 12.9 Enhanced Deployment and Monitoring

**Objective**: Improve deployment and monitoring capabilities to streamline updates and identify issues proactively.

- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Implement blue-green or canary deployment strategies to reduce downtime during updates and enable testing of new versions in production.
- **Error and Performance Monitoring**: Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry, New Relic) for real-time error tracking and performance metrics.
- **Automated Rollbacks**: Set up automated rollback policies in the CI/CD pipeline to revert to a previous version if new deployments trigger critical errors or performance issues.

### 12.10 Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics Integration

**Objective**: Integrate machine learning models and predictive analytics to provide proactive insights based on patient data.

- **Predictive Alerts**: Use ML models to analyze historical data and predict adverse events (e.g., vitals threshold alerts), improving clinical response times.
- **Data Visualization**: Incorporate charts and graphs powered by analytics libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js) to visualize patient trends and predictions.
- **Backend Model Deployment**: Coordinate with the backend team to deploy ML models as microservices, accessible through REST APIs or gRPC, ensuring seamless integration with the frontend.
