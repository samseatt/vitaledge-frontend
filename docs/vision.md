## Vision Document for VitalEdge Frontend

This revised document incorporates the current state of development and aligns the frontend with its XR counterpart. It serves as a living guide for developers and stakeholders to ensure coherence between the two platforms.

### **1. Introduction**

#### **1.1 Project Background**
The **VitalEdge Frontend** is the cornerstone of the VitalEdge Healthcare Ecosystem, designed to deliver real-time monitoring, personalized medicine, and actionable insights. It is a modular React-based Single Page Application (SPA) integrated with backend microservices, offering healthcare providers a dynamic interface to manage patient data, genomic insights, and AI-driven analytics.

The traditional frontend complements the newly developed **VitalEdge XR** platform, supporting immersive 3D and interactive views through WebXR. Together, these systems provide a comprehensive healthcare experience, blending traditional and cutting-edge immersive technologies.

#### **1.2 Purpose**
This document outlines the vision, scope, and aspirations for the traditional VitalEdge Frontend, focusing on how it supports, integrates, and complements XR functionalities. It will also serve as a guide for aligning future developments with both conventional and immersive user experiences.
